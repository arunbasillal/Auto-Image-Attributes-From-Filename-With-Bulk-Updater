Automatically Add Image Title, Caption, Description And Alt Text From Filename. Includes a bulk updater to update existing images in the Media Library

== Description ==

Automatically add Image attributes such as Image Title, Image Caption, Description And Alt Text from Image Filename. 

The plugin can update image attributes for both new images and existing images in the media library. 

With this plugin you can:

* Set the image filename as the image Title.
* Set the image filename as the image Caption.
* Set the image filename as the image Description.
* Set the image filename as the image Alt Text.
* Remove hyphens from the image filename.
* Remove underscores from the image filename.
* Choose to turn off any of the above mentioned features.

With the bulk updater you can: 

* Set the image filename as image Title, Caption, Description and Alt Text after removing hyphens and underscores from the filename.
* Update any number of images in your Media Library in one click.

If your image filename is *my_image-name.jpg*, your Image Title, Caption, Description And Alt Text will be *My Image Name*. 

The plugin settings and bulk updater are in WordPress Admin > Settings > Image Attributes. Here you can choose which attributes to update for NEW uploads. 

**Please remember to take a database backup before running the bulk updater. The bulk updater updates ALL attributes for existing images in the Media Library and ignores the settings set for NEW uploads.**
